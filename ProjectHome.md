A timer on j2me platform. It's for professional cubers to practise everywhere. It'll have these functions:
Scrambling: It can give scramble sequences for the 10 WCA official puzzles.
Timing: It can record the time you solve the puzzle.
Statistics: It can give you a lot of statistics about your times.
Cube solving: t.b.d.
Cube teaching: t.b.d.

Hopefully it will be a fully functional cube assistant before long.
